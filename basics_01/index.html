    <!-- All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
    The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
    The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
    It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: -->

    <!-- HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. -->
        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <h3>This is heading 3</h3>

    <!-- HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag: -->

        <p>This is a paragraph./p>
        <p>This is another paragraph./p>

    <!-- HTML links are defined with the <a> tag: -->

        <a href="https://www.google.co.in">Google</a>

    <!-- HTML images are defined with the <img> tag. -->
